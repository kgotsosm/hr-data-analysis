# HR Data Analysis
**This GitHub repository holds the code for analyzing HR data using Pandas library. The project involves downloading data from three XML files, analyzing the data using various Pandas functions, and generating insights from the data.**

## Skills
The project involves exploring the Pandas library and using multiple functions to analyze and view different details of the datasets. The functions used were mainly found in the Pandas documentation, which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how to read and understand the documentation of the Pandas library.

## Usage
To use the code, you can simply download or clone the repository and run the code in any Python environment that has Pandas library installed. The code loads data from three XML files, and if they are not found in the '../Data' directory, the script will download them automatically. Once the data is loaded, it is merged and analyzed using various Pandas functions, and insights are generated.

## Expansion of Project

After the data has been loaded and organies, many insights can be gained. This was beyond the scope of this particular project.
